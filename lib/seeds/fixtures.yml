- :title: Ascomycota
  :description: 'Ascomycota is a phylum of the kingdom Fungi that, together with the
    Basidiomycota, forms the subkingdom Dikarya. Its members are commonly known as
    the sac fungi or ascomycetes. It is the largest phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000
    species.[2] The defining feature of this fungal group is the "ascus" (from Greek:
    ἀσκός (askos), meaning "sac" or "wineskin"), a microscopic sexual structure in
    which nonmotile spores, called ascospores, are formed. However, some species of
    the Ascomycota are asexual, meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus
    do not form asci or ascospores.  Familiar examples of sac fungi include morels,
    truffles, brewer''s yeast and baker''s yeast, dead man''s fingers, and cup fungi.
    The fungal symbionts in the majority of lichens (loosely termed "ascolichens")
    such as Cladonia belong to the Ascomycota.'

  :description: |-
    Basidiomycota (/bəˌsɪdioʊmaɪˈkoʊtə/)[2] is one of two large divisions that, together with the Ascomycota, constitute the subkingdom Dikarya (often referred to as the "higher fungi") within the kingdom Fungi.
    More specifically, Basidiomycota includes these groups: mushrooms, puffballs, stinkhorns, bracket fungi, other polypores, jelly fungi, boletes, chanterelles, earth stars, smuts, bunts, rusts, mirror yeasts, and the human pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus.
    Basidiomycota are filamentous fungi composed of hyphae (except for basidiomycota-yeast) and reproduce sexually via the formation of specialized club-shaped end cells called basidia that normally bear external meiospores (usually four). These specialized spores are called basidiospores.[3] However, some Basidiomycota are obligate asexual reproducers. Basidiomycota that reproduce asexually (discussed below) can typically be recognized as members of this division by gross similarity to others, by the formation of a distinctive anatomical feature (the clamp connection), cell wall components, and definitively by phylogenetic molecular analysis of DNA sequence data.

- :title: Agaricus
  :description: Agaricus is a genus of mushrooms containing both edible and poisonous
    species, with possibly over 300 members worldwide.[2][3]  The genus includes the
    common ("button") mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) and the field mushroom (A. campestris),
    the dominant cultivated mushrooms of the West.
- :title: Agaricus bisporus
  :description: Agaricus bisporus is an edible basidiomycete mushroom native to grasslands
    in Europe and North America. It has two color states while immature – white and
    brown – both of which have various names, with additional names for the mature
    state.
- :title: Amanitaceae
  :description: "Amanita\nAmarrendia\nCatatrama \nLimacella\nLimacellopsis\nSaproamanita\nTorrendia\nZhuliangomyces"
- :title: Amanita
  :description: The genus Amanita contains about 600 species of agarics, including
    some of the most toxic known mushrooms found worldwide, as well as some well-regarded
    edible species. This genus is responsible for approximately 95% of the fatalities
    resulting from mushroom poisoning, with the death cap accounting for about 50%
    on its own. The most potent toxin present in these mushrooms is α-amanitin.
- :title: Amanita caesarea
  :description: Amanita caesarea, commonly known as  Caesar's mushroom, is a highly
    regarded edible mushroom in the genus Amanita, native to southern Europe and North
    Africa. While it was first described by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1772, this
    mushroom was a known favorite of early rulers of the Roman Empire.[1]
- :title: Amanita muscaria
  :description: Amanita muscaria, commonly known as the fly agaric or fly amanita,
    is a basidiomycete of the genus Amanita. It is also a muscimol mushroom. Native
    throughout the temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, Amanita
    muscaria has been unintentionally introduced to many countries in the Southern
    Hemisphere, generally as a symbiont with pine and birch plantations, and is now
    a true cosmopolitan species. It associates with various deciduous and coniferous
    trees.
- :title: Amanita phalloides
  :description: Amanita phalloides /æməˈnaɪtə fəˈlɔɪdiːz/, commonly known as the death
    cap, is a deadly poisonous basidiomycete fungus, one of many in the genus Amanita.
    Widely distributed across Europe, but now sprouting in other parts of the world,
    A. phalloides forms ectomycorrhizas with various broadleaved trees. In some cases,
    the death cap has been introduced to new regions with the cultivation of non-native
    species of oak, chestnut, and pine. The large fruiting bodies (mushrooms) appear
    in summer and autumn; the caps are generally greenish in colour with a white stipe
    and gills.  Cap colour is variable, including white forms (see Taxonomy below),
    and thus not a reliable identifier.
- :title: Boletales
  :description: The Boletales are an order of Agaricomycetes containing over 1300
    species with a diverse array of fruiting body types. The boletes are the best
    known members of this group, and until recently, the Boletales were thought to
    only contain boletes. The Boletales are now known to contain distinct groups of
    agarics, gasteromycetes, and other fruiting-body types.
- :title: Boletus
  :description: Boletus is a genus of mushroom-producing fungi, comprising over 100
    species. The genus Boletus was originally broadly defined and described by Carl
    Linnaeus in 1753, essentially containing all fungi with hymenial pores instead
    of gills. Since then, other genera have been defined gradually, such as Tylopilus
    by Petter Adolf Karsten in 1881, and old names such as Leccinum have been resurrected
    or redefined. Some mushrooms listed in older books as members of the genus have
    now been placed in separate genera. These include such as Boletus scaber, now
    Leccinum scabrum, Tylopilus felleus, Chalciporus piperatus and Suillus luteus.
    More recently, Boletus has been found to be massively polyphyletic, with only
    a small percentage of the over 300 species that have been assigned to Boletus
    actually belonging there and necessitating the description and resurrection of
    many more genera.[2][3][4][5]
- :title: Polypore
  :description: Polypores are a group of fungi that form large fruiting bodies with
    pores or tubes on the underside (see Delimitation for exceptions). They are a
    morphological group of basidiomycetes-like gilled mushrooms and hydnoid fungi,
    and not all polypores are closely related to each other. Polypores are also called
    bracket fungi, and their woody fruiting bodies are called conks.

- :title: Cantharellales
  :description: The Cantharellales are an order of fungi in the class Agaricomycetes.
    The order includes not only the chanterelles (Cantharellaceae), but also some
    of the tooth fungi (Hydnaceae), clavarioid fungi (Aphelariaceae and Clavulinaceae),
    and corticioid fungi (Botryobasidiaceae). Species within the order are variously
    ectomycorrhizal, saprotrophic, associated with orchids, or facultative plant pathogens.
    Those of economic importance include edible and commercially collected Cantharellus,
    Craterellus, and Hydnum species as well as crop pathogens in the genera Ceratobasidium
    and Thanatephorus (Rhizoctonia).
- :title: Cantharellus
  :description: Cantharellus is a genus of popular edible mushrooms, commonly known
    as chanterelles/ˌʃæntəˈrɛl/, a name which can also refer to the type species,
    Cantharellus cibarius. They are mycorrhizal fungi, meaning they form symbiotic
    associations with plants, making them very difficult to cultivate. Caution must
    be used when identifying chanterelles for consumption due to lookalikes, such
    as the Jack-O-Lantern species (Omphalotus olearius and others), which can make
    a person very ill. Despite this, chanterelles are one of the most recognized and
    harvested groups of edible mushrooms.
- :title: Chanterelle
  :description: Chanterelle is the common name of several species of fungi in the
    genera Cantharellus, Craterellus, Gomphus, and Polyozellus. They are among the
    most popular of wild edible mushrooms. They are orange, yellow or white, meaty
    and funnel-shaped. On the lower surface, underneath the smooth cap, most species
    have rounded, forked gills that run almost all the way down the stipe, which tapers
    down seamlessly from the cap. Many species emit a fruity aroma, reminiscent of
    apricots, and often have a mildly peppery taste (hence its German name, Pfifferling).
    The name chanterelle originates from the Greek kantharos meaning "tankard" or
    "cup",[1][2] a reference to their general shape.
- :title: Copelandia
  :description: Copelandia is a now deprecated [1] genus of mushrooms consisting of
    at least 12 species.[2] Many American mycologists previously placed members of
    Panaeolus which stain blue into Copelandia, whilst European mycologists generally
    used the name Panaeolus instead.  Now all mushrooms previously categorised under
    Copelandia are universally classified in Panaeolus.[1] The genus Copelandia was
    created as a subgenus of Panaeolus by Abbé Giacomo Bresadola (1847–1929) in honor
    of Edwin Bingham Copeland (1873–1964), an American who gathered fungi in the Philippines
    and sent some collections to Bresadola.

  :description: The gasteroid fungi are a group of  fungi in the Basidiomycota. Species
    were formerly placed in the obsolete class Gasteromycetes Fr. (literally "stomach
    fungi"), or the equally obsolete order Gasteromycetales Rea, because they produce
    spores inside their basidiocarps (fruit bodies) rather than on an outer surface.[1]
    However, the class is polyphyletic, as such species—which include puffballs, earthstars,
    stinkhorns, and false truffles—are not closely related to each other. Because
    they are often studied as a group, it has been convenient to retain the informal
    (non-taxonomic) name of "gasteroid fungi".

  :description: Gymnopilus is a genus of gilled mushrooms within the fungal family
    Strophariaceae containing about 200[1] rusty-orange spored mushroom species formerly
    divided among Pholiota and the defunct genus Flammula.   The fruit body is typically
    reddish brown to rusty orange to yellow, medium to large, often with a well-developed
    veil.  Most members of Gymnopilus grow on wood but at times may appear terrestrial
    if the wood is buried or decomposed. Members of Pholiota and Cortinarius are easy
    to confuse with Gymnopilus. Pholiota can be distinguished by its viscid cap and
    duller (brown to cinnamon brown) spores, and Cortinarius grows on the ground.
    Beginners can confuse Gymnopilus with Galerina, which contains deadly poisonous
    species.
- :title: Hydnoid fungi
  :description: The hydnoid fungi are a group of fungi in the Basidiomycota with basidiocarps
    (fruit bodies) producing spores on pendant, tooth-like or spine-like projections.
    They are colloquially called tooth fungi. Originally such fungi were referred
    to the genus Hydnum ("hydnoid" means Hydnum-like), but it is now known that not
    all hydnoid species are closely related.

  :description: Hymenomycetes was formerly the largest taxonomic group of fungi within
    the division Basidiomycota, but the term is no longer taxonomically relevant.
    Many familiar fungi belong to this class, including bracket fungi and toadstools.[1]
    This class contained the orders Agaricales, Boletales, and Russulales.
- :title: Inocybe
  :description: Inocybe is a large genus of mushroom-forming fungi with over 1400
    species, including all forms and variations. Members of Inocybe are mycorrhizal,
    and some evidence shows that the high degree of speciation in the genus is due
    to adaptation to different trees and perhaps even local environments.
- :title: Laetiporus
  :description: Laetiporus is a genus of edible mushrooms found throughout much of
    the world. Some species, especially Laetiporus sulphureus, are commonly known
    as sulphur shelf, chicken of the woods, the chicken mushroom, or the chicken fungus
    because many think they taste like chicken.  The name "chicken of the woods" is
    not to be confused with another edible polypore, Maitake (Grifola frondosa) known
    as "hen of the woods", or with Lyophyllum decastes, known as the "fried chicken
    mushroom". The name Laetiporus means "with bright pores".[1]
- :title: Lentinula
  :description: Lentinula is a small genus of wood-inhabiting agarics. The neotropical
    species Lentinula boryana (= L. cubensis) is the type species. However, the best-known
    species is L. edodes, the shiitake. The genus, erected by Franklin Sumner Earle
    in 1909,[2] contains eight species, principally found in tropical regions.[3]

  :description: Mycena is a large genus of small saprotrophic mushrooms that are rarely
    more than a few centimeters in width. They are characterized by a white spore
    print, a small conical or bell-shaped cap, and a thin fragile stem. Most are gray
    or brown, but a few species have brighter colors. Most have a translucent and
    striate cap, which rarely has an incurved margin. The gills are attached and usually
    have cystidia. Some species, like Mycena haematopus, exude a latex when the stem
    is broken, and many species have a chlorine-like odor.
- :title: Mycena haematopus
  :description: Mycena haematopus, commonly known as the bleeding fairy helmet, the
    burgundydrop bonnet, or the bleeding Mycena, is a species of fungus in the family
    Mycenaceae, of the order Agaricales. It is widespread and common in Europe and
    North America, and has also been collected in Japan and Venezuela. It is saprotrophic—meaning
    that it obtains nutrients by consuming decomposing organic matter—and the fruit
    bodies appear in small groups or clusters on the decaying logs, trunks, and stumps
    of deciduous trees, particularly beech. The fungus, first described scientifically
    in 1799, is classified in the section Lactipedes of the genus Mycena, along with
    other species that produce a milky or colored latex.

    in woodland areas in Europe, where it grows on decaying stumps, on buried roots
    or at the base of hardwood trees. It has also been reported from the Western Cape
    Province, South Africa.  A similar, but phylogenetically distinct[2] species found

  :description: The Pezizaceae (commonly referred to as cup fungi)  are a family of
    fungi in the Ascomycota which produce mushrooms that tends to grow in the shape
    of a "cup".  Spores are formed on the inner surface of the fruit body (mushroom).
    The cup shape typically serves to focus raindrops into splashing spores out of
    the cup.  Additionally, the curvature enables wind currents to blow the spores
    out in a different manner than in most agarics and boletes.
